Project Proposal
================

If a game is allowed then this is easy...
However for this class the proposal makes me
think that the use case for the model needs
more useful application

APIs that we should think about using:
- Java Sockets (for any server client needs between phones)
- Google/facebook sign in for any security needs
- If we are able to use google navigation:

1)	You set up settings on what type of restaurants/whatever we would want to find
	and it will (depending on whether it is silent or not) will play a sound and vibrate
	with a on screen notification with the distance from where you are and to the location that is has found.
	
	Pros
	====
	- shows use of navigation and utilizing the google system
	- shows use of background calculations
	- semi useful especially if we utilize yelp reviews
	
	Cons
	====
	- drains battery of phone very quickly
	- hard to test without actual phone
	- not entirely sure how to impliment the navigation or yelp reviews
	
	
2)	Game --> helps entertain user

3)	Might be a security issue but --> a location tracker that maps out the location and
	amount of time you spent there that day. How long the bus ride was and so forth.
	
	Pros
	====
	- being able to distinguish between a person walking and a person in a car.
	- show security knowledge will have to secure this information
	- helps user see the time they spent in their day and plan forward
	
	Cons
	====
	- again almost constant navigation use battery drains
	- VERY BIG security risk
	- not totally useful (but fun to impliment)
